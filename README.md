# Money Transfer API

### Problem Statement
Design and implement a RESTful API (including data model and the backing implementation)
for money transfers between accounts.

### Development notes

First step was developing [contracts](./src/main/resources/contracts.yaml) (OpenAPI contracts can be viewed [here](https://editor.swagger.io) ). 

I tried using KTor generator from swagger, but produced result was mediocre, so I left contract for documentation purposes only.
